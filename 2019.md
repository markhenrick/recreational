# Day 1

Since '(' and ')' are adjacent in UTF-16, we can map them to their values with the function `81 - 2*c`. There's no sensible reason to do this, but it's more interesting than a teranary expression I guess.

Alterantively you can just subtract twice the number of ')' from the length of the string.

For part two, I recall Haskell having a `scan` function which is like `reduce` but it outputs a list of the accumulation at each step. I expect that and `takeWhile` is what I need. For the Java implementation I did it the obvious imperativr way.
