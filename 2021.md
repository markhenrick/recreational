# Day 7
## Part 1

This is basically just least-squares regression right? Well in any case, the simple solution works, and I don't *think* there's a more clever mathematical way (you can refactor the sum body, but not to much avail)

$X$ = input

$$\min_{p\in \[0, \max(X)\]} \sum_{x_i\in X} |x_i - p|$$

## Part 2

For part 2, the cost per crab changes to

$$\sum_{c\in \[1, |x_i - p|\]} c = \frac{c(c+1)}{2}$$
