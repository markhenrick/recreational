This repository for little things I coded just for the sake of it, most notable **Advent of Code solutions**

I've deliberately written a lot of the code in a deliberately convoluted or unusual style to make it more interesting, so it's very far removed from code I'd ever write for production or for other people to work on. This includes both making stupidly excessive performance optimisations when a simpler solution is plenty fast, and going the other way and using a higher-order functional style to the point of performance sacrifices

Kotlin is my preferred language. Previously, this repo had C and Haskell in it too, but these are now abandoned. See the `archive` branch if you're interested. I'm slowly migrating all of the Java code to Kotlin, and the `kotlin/` dir will eventually be promoted to root

# Advent of Code

TODO: Put a star completion table here. Ideally automatically updated by an Action

The actual execution of the challenges is done via automated tests, affirmed via Github Actions. There are no plain executables or entry points

I also did the 2017 event live, though never finished, and got 29 stars. I don't still have the source but I recall using both Haskell and Python
