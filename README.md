# Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/

I've deliberately written a lot of the code in a deliberately convoluted or unusual style to make it more interesting, so it's very far removed from code I'd ever write for production or for other people to work on. Most frequently, I've tried to force Java to look like Haskell, to varying degrees of success... But generally speaking you can expect to find

* The most expressive code in Haskell
* The most performant code in C
* A general tend towards expressiveness over performance, except in C

Commentary for each year is in YEAR.md

The table below shows my progress and the languages that I want to do this in. Lots of the problems lend themselves nicely to Haskell. The main holdup is that I don't know much about IO or QoL stuff like regex in Haskell.

Each year has 50 stars available, two parts for each day of advent.

|Language|2015|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Java|10|-|-|-|-|14|14|
|Haskell|-|-|-|-|-|-|2|
|Python|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Typescript|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|C|-|-|-|-|-|-|2|

I also did the 2017 event live, though never finished, and got 29 stars. I don't still have the source but I recall using both Haskell and Python
