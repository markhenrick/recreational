# Day 7
## Part 1

This is basically just least-squares regression right? Well in any case, the simple solution works, and I don't *think* there's a more clever mathematical way (you can refactor the sum body, but not to much avail)

$X$ = input

$$\min_{p\in [0, \max(X)]} \sum_{x_i\in X} |x_i - p|$$

### Update

It has been pointed out to me that the optimal position is merely the median, due to the [optimality property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median#Optimality_property). To find the median efficiently, a selection algorithm like [QuickSelect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect) can be used

## Part 2

For part 2, the cost per crab changes to

$$\sum_{c\in [1, |x_i - p|]} c = \frac{c(c+1)}{2}$$

### Update

It has been pointed out to me that the optimal position is within 0.5 the mean, since you're approximately doing $\min_p (x_i - p)^2$. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be smarter way of figuring out *which* integer on either side of the mean it is, save for just trying both
